Decred Foundational Messaging

This messaging document is the backbone of all communications, including external marketing content (e.g., web copy, press releases, etc) and internal correspondence. It can be expanded, contracted, or tailored as needed.

AUDIENCES

Decred aims to reach a wide array of discrete audiences, from Bitcoin maximalists to Futurists. For high-level messaging purposes, these audiences can be grouped under three umbrellas:

* Technical audience: Developers, members of the Decred community, and people who are familiar with the technical nuances of blockchain technology.
* Investor audience: Individual and institutional investors who either already invest in or are interested in investing in cryptocurrency.
* Mainstream audience: Newbies to crypto and blockchain who are frustrated with the status quo of the current financial system, rentiers, and third-party intermediaries, and are interested in the promise of crypto and blockchain.

WHAT IS DECRED?

Decred is a community-driven digital currency designed to be a superior store of value for generations to come. Its transparent governance system and unique hybrid PoW+PoS consensus mechanism make it adaptable, self-sustaining and ultrasecure, and than any other coin. Decred empowers everyone involved to collectively determine the rules and budget.

TAGLINE

Decred: Evolve by Consensus[a][b]

VISION STATEMENT[c]

This is an aspirational description of what Decred aims to achieve in the long-term.

Decred’s vision is to build a self-governed, decentralized future ruled by collective intelligence rather than individuals[d][e]. It will be built upon the pillars of sovereignty, transparency, inclusivity, privacy, and security. Everyone invested in the community— with skin in the game — will make the rules with influence proportional to their stake[f][g]. Community-based decision-making, fueled by a careful alignment of incentives, will motivate members to participate and create policies in the best interest of all — not just a select few.

MISSION STATEMENT

This is a short description of what Decred aims to achieve in the short- and medium-term.

Decred is working to create[h][i] a community-based digital currency that evolves per the will of the stakeholders, all with skin in the game to make Decred the strongest cryptocurrency [j]store of value. Decred empowers every community member to participate in decentralized decision-making and voting, and rewards them through carefully aligned incentives. A self-sustaining Treasury and decisions made through collective intelligence[k] enable a seamless transition from one set of rules to another, ensuring long-term stability, adaptability and community cohesion.

POSITIONING STATEMENTS

How Decred is distinct from its competitors for each audience

Technical Audience

Decred is designed to provide developers and community members with more decentralized sovereignty, adaptability, and security than any other cryptocurrency. It does so through on- and off-chain governance systems that leverage multi-stakeholder inclusivity to make collective decisions, open-source technology, universal fungibility, and incremental security and privacy. [l][m][n][o][p] Decred’s self-sustaining funding model (10% of all block rewards go into the Treasury) and flexible, resilient contractor model allow for anyone to join Decred at any time[q][r][s] to work on projects they find most interesting and fulfilling.

Investor Audience

Decred is designed to be the best store of value of any cryptocurrency. Its transparent, community-driven governance system, which facilitates seamless consensus changes, and a self-sustaining Treasury system that directs budget and policy, provide solid protection against value-loss events like chain splits and hard forks[t]. With carefully aligned incentives that reward all community members — stakeholders, miners, and developers — for Decred’s success, the system produces a highly secure network that is self-sustaining and adaptable to stand the test of time.

Mainstream Audience[u]

Decred is a community-directed cryptocurrency designed to deliver a truly decentralized alternative to traditional money. In the current system, a centralized authority such as a bank or government holds the power. With Decred, the community members own and operate the system and make the rules. Incentives are smartly aligned to yield a hypersecure, adaptable, and superior store of value. Everyone is invested and actively involved in helping Decred succeed.

[b]Improving One Contribution at a Time
[c]An alternate vision statement i came up with: Decred is the expression of autonomy of individual contributors working collaboratively towards a common goal. Decred is a real world, global implementation of crypto-anarchic free market capatalism in its internal contributor economy and aspires to be a medium of exchange in real world that reflects this internal economy. - sambiohazard
[d]it still reads a bit strange, almost like we hope AI will take over humanity


can we change it to "ruled by the collective intelligence of all individuals" instead?
[e]or "ruled by the collective intelligence of the community"
[f]"will have the opportunity to influence rules (or decisions) based on their proportional stake"
[g]when you say "will make" it sounds like an obligation (while it's optional)
[h]most of the things described here are already implemented. when you put it like this, it seems we are still working on it (when is the ICO?)
[i]haha
[j]not necessary. I actually strongly suggest to remove it, or replace it with "digital" (as opposed to an offline store of value such as silver)
[k]how do you make decisions through collective intelligence? I'd say the decisions are made "through hybrid PoW/PoS consensus", while _using_ the collective intelligence of the group
[l]This sentence is broken, turns into word salad after collective decisions.
[m]Agree. We can put a period after collective decisions, then decide how to deal with the other elements. Are they important to the technical audience, and if so, how do we incorporate them here?


Seems to me that open source tech and incremental security and privacy fit here, but universal fungibility is more a quality of currency, not a technical aspect.
[n]Agree with all of this. I would shift open source, security and privacy to the end of the paragraph, in a sentence like "The Treasury's mandate, endorsed by stakeholders, is to promote free and open source software that enhances privacy and security."
[o]"governance systems that leverage multi-stakeholder inclusivity" is a bit misleading, because in reality it's only those with "skin in the game" that have a vote. there are other ways to participate, but saying that our governance systems leverage inclusivity is false marketing
[p]I agree with Richard's suggestion of moving the remainder of the text to the final sentence. my proposed text: "Expenditures from the Treasury are endorsed by stakeholders and aim to promote free and open source software that enhances privacy and security." (since the sentence before it starts with 's already)
[q]I think repetition of anyone makes it sound too easy. It's also probably not true that anyone can join, a degree of compatibility is required.
[r]right -- how about like-minded developers/software engineers? or do we want to name a specific skill you need to have?
[s]maybe use "contributors" instead of "anyone" to refer to those working on projects more specifically?


it doesn't have to be more specific in my opinion. even though _some_ degree of compatibility may be needed to eventually become a contractor, you can start working on projects any time you want without being hindered
[t]I feel like this sentence should lose a comma somewhere; it is a bit too complex for me right now
[u]excellent statement!
[v]too complex for non-native speakers
[w]maybe we can replace this with "Cypherpunks" which links back to the origins of Bitcoin and cryptography
[x]Talented
[y]this word has to go. it just doesn't make sense! Decred's price is very volatile, even the consensus code is adaptable (first word on this list)
[z]we could consider synonyms that cover what you want to express (cohesive is a good example, already on the list)
[aa]I see how this is not accurate as related to price. And yes, that doesn't make sense. Think this was meant to be stable as in "enduring" -- which is already on the list. So, we can delete it.
[ab]You could change it to Robust, or maybe Reliable?
