Decred Foundational Messaging

The purpose of foundational messaging is to serve as the backbone of all communications, including web copy, press releases, and internal correspondence. It can be expanded, contracted, or tailored as needed.

AUDIENCES

Decred aims to reach a wide array of discrete audiences, from Bitcoin maximalists to Futurists. For high-level messaging purposes, these audiences can be grouped under three umbrellas:

* Technical audience: Developers, members of the Decred community, and people who are familiar with the technical nuances of blockchain technology.
* Investor audience: Individual and institutional investors who either already invest in or are interested in investing in cryptocurrency.
* Mainstream audience: Newbies to crypto and blockchain who are frustrated with the status quo of the current financial system, rentiers, and third-party intermediaries, and are interested in the promise of crypto and blockchain.

WHAT IS DECRED?

Decred is an autonomous[a][b] digital currency[c][d][e] that is designed to evolve and endure for generations[f][g] to come. It solves the original problems of cryptocurrency[h][i][j][k][l][m][n] by employing [o][p]a self-funding mechanism and an open and transparent system of governance[q] that empowers those with skin in the game to collectively determine the rules and budget.[r]

VISION STATEMENT[ao][ap]

This is an aspirational description of what Decred aims to achieve in the long-term.

Decred’s vision is to build an autonomous[aq][ar], decentralized future in which the world is self-governed by collective intelligence[as][at][au] rather than individuals[av]. This world will be underpinned by the pillars of sovereignty, transparency, inclusivity, privacy, and security. Those with skin in the game will make the rules with influence proportional to their stake — eliminating the possibility for small groups or individuals to unfairly accumulate wealth and power[aw][ax]. Community-based decision-making, fueled by a careful alignment of incentives and free from third-party influence[ay], will yield a world governed by policy[az][ba], not people[bb][bc].

MISSION STATEMENT

This is a short description of what Decred aims to achieve in the short- and medium-term.

Decred is on a mission to[bd] create an autonomous digital currency that evolves per the will of the stakeholders, all with skin in the game and[be][bf] a personal interest in making Decred better. Decred empowers every community member to participate in decentralized decision-making and voting, and rewards them through carefully aligned incentives. Decisions made through collective intelligence[bg], as well as a sustainably self-funded Treasury, enable a seamless transition from one set of rules to another — ensuring long-term stability and community cohesion.

POSITIONING STATEMENTS

These are descriptions of how Decred fills each audience’s needs[bh] in a way its competitors don’t.

Technical Audience

Decred is designed to provide developers and community members with more sovereignty, flexibility to evolve, and decentralization than any other cryptocurrency. It does so through 100% [bi]proven open-source technology, incremental security and privacy, universal fungibility, and on-chain and off-chain governance systems that leverage multi-stakeholder inclusivity[bj][bk] to make collective decisions. Decred’s sustainable self-funding and resilient contractor model allow for anyone to join Decred at any time[bl][bm][bn] to help build the future.

Investor Audience

Decred is designed to be the best store of value of any cryptocurrency. It does so through a transparent, community-driven governance system that facilitates seamless consensus changes that avoid value-loss events like chain splits[bo][bp][bq], and through a self-funded Treasury system that directs budget and policy — ensuring that Decred will prevail over time. [br][bs][bt]

Mainstream Audience

Decred is a community-directed cryptocurrency designed to deliver a truly decentralized alternative to traditional money. In the current system, a centralized authority (such as a bank or government) holds the power, but with Decred, the community members own and operate the system and get to make their own rules[bu]. When members contribute to the community, they earn more cryptocurrency[bv] and have more skin in the game. Everyone is invested in[bw][bx] making Decred better.

[a]we don't even need an adjective here. "Decred is a digital currency"
[b]i agree, in general autonomous suggest that there is no interference or participation from any entity outside the system. Decred probably is opposite of that with every decision being made via many people interacting in many different ways. Open (as in open source) Collaborative is probably more closer to how decred functions - sambiohazard
[c]+tanel@eeter.co suggests "cryptocurrency"
_Tilldelad till tanel_
[d]cryptocurrency is too narrow, it'll only resonate with a small set of people (not mainstream enough)
[e]maybe Digital Money, even more simple language and main usecase of our token in the long run - sambiohazard
[f]perhaps switch to "decades"
[g]now that I'm thinking about it, the word "generations" suggests that you can buy DCR for your (grand-)children. that's a good thing!
[h]I think this is too big a leap to take at the start, it is a long sentence that doesn't explain what the "original problems of cryptocurrency" are. It is contentious and may come across as arrogant to lead with the idea that we know what the "original problems" are, and have solved them.
[i]How about: "It strives to advance the crytocurrency ideal of uncensorable money by establishing new constituencies to look after and develop the network. Voters with skin in the game collectively determine the rules and budgets, while a contractor [cooperative/collective/collaborative]is funded to make it all happen by a transparently governed Treasury."
[j]I really like how you worded it in your suggestion!
[k]this is a good direction. one note: "constituencies" is way too complex, it needs to be super simple. I would also mention the word "blockchain" in the introduction
[l]this writer suggests that we retire the word "blockchain" altogether: https://jonchoi.com/opennetworks/
[m]Nic Carter had a post about that too. I'm not using "blockchain" much any more personally because it is too broad and has lost meaning.
[n]how about "It builds on and improves the original innovations of bitcoin"? Acknowledging that we stand on shoulder of giants and improve on it - sambiohazard
[o]too complex, keep it simple
[p]... innovations of bitcoin "with a verifiable (instead of open and transparent)" governance system that empowers.... - sambiohazard
[q]governance system
[r]future [technological & financial] direction. - sambiohazard
[s]For reference, here are some competitor's tags:
Innovative Payment Network and a new kind of money
Build Unstoppable Apps
DASH is Digital Cash
Internet Money
Private Digital Currency
The World’s Only Enterprise Solution for Global Payments
The Most Powerful Infrastructure for Decentralized Applications
Formalizing Blockchain Governance
[t]I feel like we need many more iterations before we land on a good tagline for Decred
[u]I think "Skin in the Game" is best tagline for decred - sambiohazard
[v]I think we should focus more on empowerment of Individual here instead of Autonomous or collective - sambiohazard
[w]One more thought on this: The network of contributors/stakeholders and the innovation they produce in form of the blockchain & p2p network and other deliverables, is the actual substance that makes this whole thing valuable. currency is the glue that keeps all this together. So again focus should be on Collaboration, Individuals, and how they produce the underlying value.
[x]there were talks of dropping the word "autonomous" since it's linked to self-driving cars
[y]independent
[z]How about "sovereign"? We could debate whether or not Decred is "sovereign" but maybe is too complex.
How about "sustainable digital currency"?
[aa]Self-governing ?
[ab]i like this one. Its catchy and covers most of governance process. although its more like Join. Contribute. Earn. Stake. Vote. Maybe 2 taglines "Join. Contribute. Earn." for contributors/techies & "Buy. Stake. Vote." for investors. - sambiohazard
[ac]Also not a fan of collection intelligence term.
[ad]agree
[ae]imo, I think is a great concept that reflect how collaborative, open source efforts should work, the unleashed I'm not sure tho
[af]why you don't like it?
[ag]collective intelligence is a great concept, but we need to be careful with its usage. it could appear that we are creating 'hype' rather than real value (just like AI, machine learning, smart contracts, etc.)
[ah]who is the queen bee?
[ai]snooze button
[aj]wake up, Dustin!
[ak]its not catchy but i like it, at least its correct.
[al]too cheesy?
[am]a bit, but it works, for a broader mainstream audience this is going to be easy to understand and appealling for younger generations. Not sure everyone likes the "be your own bank" narrative but I think is going to be massively used throughout the industry
[an]i agree this again reflects what is true - sambiohazard
[ao]Incredibly commie and technological singularity like. eww. Again I think you need to drop this whole theme of collective & autonomous. Its antithetical to what decred stands for. Decred is all about making easy via its governance system, the voluntary contribution from individuals that are decentralized/distributed and thus making the currency valuable. Only thing influencing the individuals is the incentive structure/game theory, which again si created by the OG individuals.
[ap]sambiohazard
[aq]what does an autonomous future look like? will robots take over?
[ar]In English the word "autonomous" is linked more to robots and self-driving cars, in Spanish is linked to the autonomy of original communities, which is closer to the meaning we want for Decred, interesting
[as]communities?
[at]"communitarian intelligence"?
[au]collective intelligence of the community
[av]corporations
[aw]I don't think "accumulate" works well in this context, following a sentence about "influence proportional to stake". Stake can be accumulated. Also "eliminating the possibility for small groups or individuals to unfairly accumulate wealth and power" is a very general (and bold) statement to make!
[ax]agreed. we cannot prevent anyone from accumulating large amounts of DCR and thereby effectively controlling the project.


also, the word "unfair" implies a normative framework (rules to determine what is fair)
[ay]this is never the case. nobody knows everything, so people are getting their information from somewhere (which implies a third party)
[az]is this the ultimate vision of Decred? that sounds boring :D
[ba]I think the ultimate mission of Decred is to rethink/transform money and governance through community driven decision making and community driven wealth creation
[bb]this seems to contradict the first part of the sentence where it says "community-based"
[bc]community based, community driven, by the people for the people (too commie?)
[bd]this could imply that we haven't built anything yet, I suggest rewording
[be]skin in the game *ensures* that people have a personal interest in making Decred better
[bf]for example: per the will of the stakeholders with skin in the game, which ensures they have a personal interest in making Decred better
[bg]I don't like this much, "collective intelligence" is being used in a buzz-wordy fashion, a casually made grand claim. How about "Decisions made by stakeholders with skin in the game, and implemented with funding from a sustainably self-funded Treasury..."
[bh]maybe we should start with formulating their need (very briefly), before we start thinking about how to explain how Decred fills it?
[bi]no software is 100% proven
[bj]buzzword alarm is ringing
[bk]mine too
[bl]lol, I would tone this down a notch, it sounds like I can sign up by verifying my email address.
[bm]how about: "Decred’s block-reward-funded independent contractor network is open to people who show up and work to help build the future."
[bn]I think "self-funded" in this context sounds like they fund themselves. I had "treasury-funded", but for a technical external audience I think "block-reward-funded" is better.
[bo]I really like the fork resistance/anti chain split point and think it is imperative to reiterate when marketing, following the BCH debacles of the last 2 years.


No brand dilution.
[bp]No brand dilution! Emphasis on community cohesion and communitarian wealth preservation
[bq]Yes I am surprised that split resistant or fork resistant are not amongst the final contenders for terms to describe Decred. That is a big selling point imo and quite concise.
[br]I would suggest adding a bit about PoS enhancing the security of Decred relative to pure PoW coins with equivalent hashpower. If the investors don't understand those concepts we don't want them staking ;)
[bs]maybe we can also bring up that they can participate in governing their investment (sort of a decentralized share holder meeting)
[bt]Yes, enhancing the security and  perhaps quantifying this by the 20 times more secure figure.
[bu]that phrase does not sound good to me, it sounds like rule changes are a casual thing. How about "but with Decred, the stakeholder community has a key role in the operation of the system, giving them the power to enforce the rules and decide when they change."
[bv]decred or DCR?
[bw]"invested" sounds too profit-driven, I would prefer something like "Everyone's incentives are aligned around making Decred better."
[bx]to make Decred better
[by]not keen
[bz]too cheesy indeed
[ca]haha
[cb]I dislike hive / hub (overly used)
[cc]tricky word, it can mean negative things as well (sticking to one ideology over another)
[cd]neutral about what? I would say its defined by what people are in agreement on.
[ce]Decred is not a stable coin
