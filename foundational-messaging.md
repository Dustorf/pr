Decred Foundational Messaging

This messaging document is the backbone of all communications, including external marketing content (e.g., web copy, press releases, etc) and internal correspondence. It can be expanded, contracted, or tailored as needed.

AUDIENCES

Decred aims to reach a wide array of discrete audiences, from Bitcoin maximalists to Futurists. For high-level messaging purposes, these audiences can be grouped under three umbrellas:

* Technical audience: Developers, members of the Decred community, and people who are familiar with the technical nuances of blockchain technology.
* Investor audience: Individual and institutional investors who either already invest in or are interested in investing in cryptocurrency.
* Mainstream audience: Newbies to crypto and blockchain who are frustrated with the status quo of the current financial system, rentiers, and third-party intermediaries, and are interested in the promise of crypto and blockchain.

WHAT IS DECRED?

Its built-in transparent governance system and unique hybrid PoW/PoS consensus mechanism make it more secure, adaptable, and self-sustaining than any other coin. Decred empowers everyone involved to collectively determine the rules and budget.

TAGLINE

Decred: Evolve by Consensus

VISION STATEMENT

This is an aspirational description of what Decred aims to achieve in the long-term.

Decred’s vision is to build a self-governed, decentralized future ruled by collective intelligence rather than individuals. It will be built upon the pillars of sovereignty, transparency, inclusivity, privacy, and security. Everyone invested in the community— with skin in the game — will make the rules with influence proportional to their stake. Community-based decision-making, fueled by a careful alignment of incentives, will motivate members to participate and create policies in the best interest of all — not just a select few.

MISSION STATEMENT

This is a short description of what Decred aims to achieve in the short- and medium-term.

Decred is working to create a community-based digital currency that evolves per the will of the stakeholders, all with skin in the game to make Decred the strongest cryptocurrency store of value. Decred empowers every community member to participate in decentralized decision-making and voting, and rewards them through carefully aligned incentives. A self-sustaining Treasury and decisions made through collective intelligence enable a seamless transition from one set of rules to another, ensuring long-term stability, adaptability and community cohesion.

POSITIONING STATEMENTS

How Decred is distinct from its competitors for each audience

Technical Audience

Decred is designed to provide developers and community members with more decentralized sovereignty, adaptability, and security than any other cryptocurrency. It does so through on- and off-chain governance systems that leverage multi-stakeholder inclusivity to make collective decisions, open-source technology, universal fungibility, and incremental security and privacy. Decred’s self-sustaining funding model (10% of all block rewards goes back to the Treasury) and flexible, resilient contractor model allow for anyone to join Decred at any time to work on projects they find most interesting and fulfilling.

Investor Audience

Decred is designed to be the best store of value of any cryptocurrency. Its transparent, community-driven governance system, which facilitates seamless consensus changes, and a self-sustaining Treasury system that directs budget and policy, provide solid protection against value-loss events like chain splits and hard forks. With carefully aligned incentives that reward all community members — stakeholders, miners, and developers — for Decred’s success, the system produces a highly secure network that is self-sustaining and adaptable to stand the test of time.

Mainstream Audience

Decred is a community-directed cryptocurrency designed to deliver a truly decentralized alternative to traditional money. In the current system, a centralized authority such as a bank or government holds the power. With Decred, the community members own and operate the system and make their own rules. Incentives are smartly aligned to yield a hypersecure, adaptable, and superior store of value. Everyone is invested and actively involved in helping Decred succeed.
